# trend_locator
Application that uses twitter API to show a map of where a trend originated, and how it has spread/progressed over time.

### Tech used
Part of the reason I wanted to do this was also to learn to use some new tech such as the tech below:
+ D3
+ Flask/python
+ Google Maps API
+

### Credits
Inital idea to play with the Twitter API came from CS50, an intro CS class at Harvard that I am on staff as a teaching fellow. This year we rolled out a new problem set that did basic sentiment analysis with the twitter API and I thought it was cool so I decided to play with the API to do something else.
