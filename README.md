# sentiment_locator
Fun application that uses twitter API and Stanford University's CoreNLP to show a map of where the strongest positive and negative sentiments from english rhetoric come from.


# Credits
Inital idea to do something with the Twitter API came from CS50, a intro CS class at Harvard that I am on staff to help teach with this year. This year we rolled out a new problem set that did basic sentiment analysis with the twitter API and I thought it was cool so I decided to expand on it a bit.

Credit for algorithm to determine sentiments of tweets goes entirely to Stanford.
